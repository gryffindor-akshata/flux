# Flux Investor Pitch (Confidential)

**Vision**
Flux is the agentic commerce infrastructure layer. We make the web machine-readable, agent-safe, and transaction-ready so autonomous agents can buy on behalf of people and businesses. Think Stripe + Shopify for the agentic web.

**Problem Today**
- Agents scrape brittle pages with no canonical catalog or checkout flows.
- Merchant APIs were built for browsers, not AI actors, creating security and provenance gaps.
- Every agent developer and retailer must rebuild feeds, risk controls, and payments from scratch.

**Solution**
1. **Agentic Commerce Feed (ACF):** Signed JSON inventory feeds via the ACP spec and plug-ins for Shopify, SFCC, BigCommerce, and WooCommerce.
2. **Agentic Search API:** Hybrid vector + keyword discovery returning ranked, signed offers with provenance.
3. **Agentic Checkout Rail:** Flux PayLink plus third-party processors; embeds reservation, risk, and anti-injection guardrails.
4. **Trust & Identity Layer:** Merchant DIDs, JWS signatures, buyer/agent consent proofs, and audit trails.

**Customers & Go-to-Market**
- Phase 1: AI agent platforms (OpenAI GPTs, Rabbit, Perplexity) and LLM infra (LangChain, Dust).
- Phase 2: Shopify/SFCC merchants installing Flux to become agent-ready.
- Phase 3: Marketplaces (Amazon, DoorDash, Etsy) adopting ACP for open inventory.

**Business Model**
- Usage pricing for APIs (e.g., $X per 1,000 search calls).
- 1% fee on transactions via Flux PayLink.
- SaaS tiers ($49–$499/month) for feed hosting, analytics, verification badges.
- Enterprise licensing for private ACP nodes (Nike, Walmart).

**Why Now**
- Agents like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude are adding purchasing flows.
- Regulators demand provenance and safety (EU AI Act, FTC AI labeling).
- Retailers already publish schema.org data; Flux adds the signed, real-time protocol layer.

**Moat & Flywheel**
- Open protocol with cryptographic provenance beats closed marketplaces.
- More Flux-verified merchants → better agent results → more transactions → stronger risk data → deeper trust badges.

**12-Month Roadmap**
- Q1: Release ACP v1 and open-source SDKs (Python, JS, Go).
- Q2: Launch Flux Pay sandbox and Shopify App connector.
- Q3: Run pilot programs with Nike, Allbirds, and Shopify Plus brands.
- Q4: Ship trust/provenance dashboard and agent analytics API.

**Ask**
Raising capital to expand protocol engineering, merchant integrations, and risk/compliance operations so Flux becomes the default agent-to-merchant commerce standard.
